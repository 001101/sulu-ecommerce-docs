Installation
============

Get the code
------------

First of all you have to clone the `sulu-complete repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu-complete>`_ and change into the cloned
directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:sulu-io/sulu-complete.git

Please follow the installation instructions provided at the github page.

Install dependencies
--------------------

We use `composer`_ to install the correct versions of
Sulu's dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer install

This will install everything that's needed for a basic sulu ecommerce installation.
