Shop navigation
===============

Where to find the navigation

The shop navigation is defined by content object in the admin interface. Once a
new item is added it can be set as a navigation element in the settings tab.
The first two levels of of content elements are displayed as parent - child
navigation.

Open the admin interface and click on the content area of your shop webspace you
want to add a navigation. Initial there are no content items. Click on the **new**
button and add a new content item. There are two important things you need: a
title which is displayed as your navigation title and an url where this item is
pointing to. Click save once you are finished. Alright now you have created a
new content item which can be opened with the url you have given it. To make it
a navigation item choose the category template in the template dropdown and make
sure your content item has the state *published*. We are almost done, now switch
open the settings tab and add your content item to the main navigation with the
navigation dropdown. Make sure you have changed your settings. Check out your
shop and you will notice your first navigation item is displayed.
