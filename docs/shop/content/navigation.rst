Shop navigation
===============

Where to find the navigation
----------------------------

The shop navigation is defined by content pages in the admin interface. Once a
new item is added it can be set as a navigation element in the settings tab. The
first two levels of content elements are displayed as parent - child navigation.

.. hint:: It is recommended to avoid heavy nested structures. Keep it simple.

How to create a navigation
--------------------------

Open the admin interface and click on the content area of your shop webspace where
you want to add a navigation. Initially there are no content items. Click on the
*new button* and add a new content item. There are two important things you need:
a title which is displayed as your navigation title and an url where this item is
pointing to. Click save once you are finished. Alright now you have created a
new content item which can be opened with the url you have chosen. To make it
a navigation item choose the category template in the dropdown and make sure your
content item has the state *published*. We are almost done, now switch to the
settings tab and add your content item to the main navigation in the navigation
dropdown. Make sure you have changed your settings. Check out your shop and you
will notice your first navigation item is displayed.

.. hint:: If you have chosen a unique title the url field will be autocompleted.

How to create a sub navigation
------------------------------

Open the admin interface and click on the content area of your shop webspace you
want to add a sub navigation. Choose an item and highlight it by clicking on its
name. In the column on the right it is possible to add a new sub navigation item
by clicking on the add button. Now repeat the steps of creating a navigation
item and save it. Refresh your shop and you will find a new sub navigation item
in your navigation.

Link navigation to categories
-----------------------------

In order to find products for a specific navigation item you have to link it with
a category. Therefore visit the admin interface and navigate to the item you want
to connect with a category. Click the edit button and switch to the *category* tab.
Now choose one or many categories and save the item.
