User Management
===============

The user management section allows a shop admin to manage the users for his
account. To reach this section a special user role named 'Shop-Admin' is
required.

User List
---------

The user list represents a list of users who are part of the same account.
The list offers some basic information such as the first name and the last
name of the user, as well as the email address and the users order ceiling.
To quickly see which user is disabled or locked, such users are differently
displayed in the list.

Add User
--------

Add a new user by clicking on the 'Add a new user' button below the user
list. Fill in the form fields in the overlay and press 'save'.

Edit User
---------

Edit a user by clicking on the a row in the list. Within the overlay the
users data can be edited.

Delete User
-----------

Find a user in the user list and press on the 'x' icon on the left side.
Confirm your action to delete the user. To make sure no required information
about the user is lost which could be needed for invoices or orders, the user
is only disconnected from the account but still exists in the system.

Enable/Disable User
-------------------

If a user needs to be disabled, click on the user's row in the user list.
Inside the overlay you will find a checkbox 'disable user'. Once this box
is checked a user is disabled. This means the user is still connected to
the account but can no longer login to the online shop.

Order Ceiling
-------------

Click on a user's row in the user list. Inside the overlay there is a section
called 'order ceiling'. This setting controls which total sum a user is able to
order per month. If the user exceeds his order limit, he is not able to submit
the shopping cart. The shopping cart will be disabled and an email is send to
the shop admin to review the order. The shop admin decides if the order is
valid or not and admits or rejects it.
