Order Ceiling
=============

The order ceiling defines an order limit for users per month. It can only be set
or changed by a shop admin in the user management section of the shop. If an
user as a order ceiling set and tries to order more than the set sum the shopping
cart will be disabled.

Exceeded Order Ceiling List
---------------------------

A shop admin can see a list of all exceeded order ceilings in the company
settings. The list shows some quick information such as the user name, the
oder date and the total sum of the order. By clicking on a order the shop
user can download a pdf version of the order to check it. Use the action
buttons to admit or reject the order.

Exceeded Order Ceiling

Once a user exceeds his order ceiling, his shopping cart is disabled and he is
no longer able to submit the shopping cart but can still see its content. An
notification email is send to the shop admin of his account who is now able to
admit or reject the
order.

Admitted or Rejected Orders
---------------------------

Once an order is submitted or rejected the user will be able to fill his
shopping cart again.
