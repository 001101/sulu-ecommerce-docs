Order Ceiling
=============

The order ceiling defines an order limit for users per month. It can only be set
or changed by a shop admin in the user management section of the shop. If an
user has an order ceiling set and tries to order more than the set sum the shopping
cart will be disabled.

Exceeded Order Ceiling List
---------------------------

A shop admin can see a list of all exceeded order ceilings in the company
settings. The list shows some quick information such as the users name, the
oder date and the total sum of the order. By clicking on an order the shop
user can download a pdf version of the order to review it. Use the action
buttons in the overlay to admit or reject an order.

Exceeded Order Ceiling
----------------------

Once a user exceeds his order ceiling, his shopping cart is disabled and he is
no longer able to submit the shopping cart but can still see its content. A
notification email is send to the shop admin who is able to admit or reject the
order.

Admitted or Rejected Orders
---------------------------

Once an order is submitted or rejected the users shopping cart will be cleared
and the user is able to put new items to it.
