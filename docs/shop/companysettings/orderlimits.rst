Order Ceiling
=============

The order ceiling defines the maximum amount of money, a user is allowed to
order (spend) per month. It can only be set or changed by a shop admin in the
user management section of the shop. If a user has an order ceiling set and
the sum of all orders exceeds this limit, the shopping cart will be disabled.
Moreover, the webshop-admin of the user is going to be notified by email and
then has do accept or decline the order, before the user is going to be able
to continue shopping.

A shop admin can see a list of all exceeded order ceilings in the company

oder date and the total sum of the order. By clicking on an order the shop
user can download a pdf version of the order to review it. Use the action
buttons in the overlay to accept or reject an order.
