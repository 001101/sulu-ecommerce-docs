Sulu E-Commerce
===============

What is Sulu E-Commerce?
------------------------

Sulu E-Commerce is an extension for `Sulu CMF <http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/>`_.
It is designed to help you build any online e-commerce system you need. The main
goal is to provide an online shop where you can present your products and offer
the ability to buy certain products.

Sulu E-Commerce strategy for large scale usage
----------------------------------------------

Unlike small B2C shops which usually have to maintain just about one hundred
products, this strategy is designed for large online shops with thousands
or even millions of products. This is a regular usecase for marketplaces or
large B2B online shops. Where products in a B2C shop with less than one hundred
products could be maintained manually, this is simply impossible for large
marketplaces. However the functionality in the admin interface is the same for
all of our Sulu E-Commerce strategies. Which means products can still be edited
manually if needed.
