User Password
=============

Change password
---------------

To change the password, a user must be logged in. On the top right corner there
is a link to **Password change**. Clicking on it opens a new overlay to change
the password. The current password must be given and a valid new password. After
completing this process, the new password is stored and the user stays logged in.

Forgotten password
------------------

If a user is not logged in there is a **password forgotten** link on the sulu
login screen ``domain.tld/admin``. By quoting the users email address, an email
with a password reset link is sent to that address.
