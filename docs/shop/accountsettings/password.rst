Change password
---------------

To change the password a user must be logged in. On the top right corner there
is a link to **Password change**. Clicking on it opens a new overlay to change
the password. The current password must be given and a valid new password. Once
the password is changed the user stays logged in.

If a user is not logged in there is a **password forgotten** link on the sulu
login screen. By quoting the email address the user has stored, an email with
a password reset link is send to that address.
